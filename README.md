# Text Preprocessing

Text preprocessing is a crucial step in natural language processing (NLP) that involves cleaning and transforming raw text data into a format that can be easily understood and analyzed by machine learning algorithms. These techniques are essential for many NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and machine translation.
